Stop making excuses and repeating what you have said, understand that people hear you the first time. Do not give your merits and awards to other people, learn to feel valuable and meaningful.\n2. Start making decisions and saying \"No\". If you don't agree with something, it's better to say it than to silently agree with everything and regret it later. Do not ask what you need to do, but rather ask what you need to finish. Do not leave less preferred options open, choose one thing and move on. Give employees clear instructions, and give customers clear answers if they ask.\n3. Focus, focus, focus. Write down for each project why you are doing this and where you want to come. Write the same thing about your life in general. Understand your intentions and goals. Don't be afraid to want and don't settle for less. Do not be distracted by solving other people's problems, separate yourself from other people. Remind yourself of what is important to you.",
